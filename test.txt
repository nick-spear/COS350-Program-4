1 test file for the scroll program in cos350
2 the lines are numbered to help you see the file
3 most of the lines are otherwise blank

5 If you are ever unsure how this file should look, compare it to more.
6 If you are just paging through a file, the output should be identical to more
7 except that you will probably have a different prompt.

23 this is line 23, the last initial line displayed on an 80x24 terimal
24 this is line 24, but you don't see it initially because of the prompt
25 the line above should be at the top when paging

70 Now we will try a long line to see how line wrapping works. If it works correctly this line should scroll up one line's worth at a time. Otherwise I would probably expect that the scrolling will jump up as the entire line is output to the display.

72 Now a test of tabs
73 	one tab					| a	|
74 		two tab				| bb	|
75 			red tab			| ccc	|
76 				blue tab	| dddd	|
